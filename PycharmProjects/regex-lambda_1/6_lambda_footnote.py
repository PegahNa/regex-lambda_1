IMPORTANT NOTES:

These lambda_examples have shown just how easy lambda functions are.
Still, there are a few uses where lambda functions should not be used!

 - If you're doing anything more than a basic task, or want to call
   other methods, use a normal function.

 - Lambdas are great for one off, anonymous functions,
   but they must only have one single expression.

 - If your lambda starts growing in size and looking like a common expression,
   then it is probably time to refactor in to a stand alone normal function.
